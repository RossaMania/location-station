# Location Station

This is an app I did as part of a "code along" course on Udemy. It is a full stack app that uses React, Express, Node, and MongoDB. This app allows users to "check in" to places they have been. This functionality is similar to FourSquare and other apps!

## Features

- User sign up/log in.
- Google Maps API.
- Users can create, edit, and delete places.
- Users can add URLs of photos.



### Here's more about the React, NodeJS, Express & MongoDB - The MERN Fullstack Guide on Udemy!

MERN stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React.js and Node.js - and combined, these four technologies allow you to build amazing web applications.

In this course, we'll build an entire project and you will learn how these different technologies work together step by step. We'll first have a look at all the individual building blocks, so that we then can also combine them all into one amazing application by the end of the course.

This course also doesn't stop after the basics - instead, you'll also learn how to add file upload, authentication, authorization and how to deploy your application in different ways to different hosting services.

This course is taught by two instructors - Max (React.js, Node/ Express) and Manuel (MongoDB) who have years of experience of working with these technologies and teaching them to other people. We took and combined our experiences to deliver you the best possible MERN stack course you can find out there.

### In detail, this course offers:

- Brief refreshers on the core technologies (React, Node, Express, MongoDB)

- Project sections for each technology where the theoretic knowledge is applied

- Detailed theory about the MERN stack and the different ways of combining the technologies

- A complete course project where all the technologies come together into one application

- File (image) upload in both React.js (sending the file) and Node/ Express (receiving the file)

- User authentication (signup + login)

- User authorization (controlling access to certain resources)

- Detailed deployment instructions - including different ways of deploying the application

- Tons of quizzes and extra resources!

By the end of this course, you'll feel comfortable building your own MERN stack applications and you can build up on all the knowledge taught throughout this course to dive into your own projects and use-cases.

- What are the requirements for taking this course?

- NO prior MERN stack knowledge is required

- Basic React.js knowledge is strongly recommended - a refresher is provided as part of the course but this course is NOT meant to teach React from the ground up

- Basic Node + Express knowledge is recommended but not a must-have

As always, this course comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee.

We'd love to dive into this course together with you!

- Add File Upload to ReactJS + Node/ Express Applications

### Are there any course requirements or prerequisites?
- Basic knowledge about ReactJS is required
- ReactJS Hooks knowledge is recommended
- Basic knowledge about Node, Express and MongoDB is recommended but not a must-have
- NO expert React knowledge or MERN knowledge is required

### Who this course is for:
- Developers who got basic React knowledge and now want to build a fullstack app
- Advanced React developers who are interested in connecting React apps to Node/ Express
- Node/ Express developers who want to learn how to add a modern frontend to their backend

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
